## Appendix C - IEEE C37.118 Mapping

Today most all synchrophasor deployments include IEEE C37.118 in various parts of the infrastructure, this section describes how STTP will be mapped to and from IEEE C37.118 streams so that interoperability can be established with the existing protocol implementations and STTP, see [Figure 7](#user-content-figure7).
