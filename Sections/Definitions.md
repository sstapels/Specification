### Definitions and Nomenclature

The styles used to show code, notes, etc.  

> :construction: To spice up the formatting of the spec, GitHub offers a library of emogi's.  some that we might want to play into nomenclature  :mag: :bulb: :computer: :wrench: :file_folder: :package: :pushpin: :new: :arrow_right: :arrow_forward: :arrows_counterclockwise: :hash: :soon: :heavy_plus_sign: :black_small_square: :paperclip: :warning: :information_source: :page_facing_up: :bar_chart: :earth_americas: :globe_with_meridians:  From use of the atom editor, it Looks like some are unique to GitHub and others are part of more standard collections.  Or we could make some custom ones that would be included as images.

For example,

> :information_source: This is an instructional note in the spec.

or for example,

> :warning: This is a very important note in the spec.
