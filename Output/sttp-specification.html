<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This specification defines a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a> data transfer protocol that has been optimized for exchanging streaming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series">time series</a> style data, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasor_measurement_unit">synchrophasor</a> data that is used in the electric power industry, over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP). The protocol supports transferring both real-time and historical time series data at full or down-sampled resolutions. Protocol benefits are realized at scale when multiplexing very large numbers of time series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_point">data points</a> at high speed, such as, hundreds of times per second per data point.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Use of synchrophasors by U.S. utilities continues to grow following the jump start provided by the Smart Grid Investment Grants (2010-2014). Several utilities now have PMU installation counts of 500 phasor measurement units (PMUs) or more and other utilities anticipate being at this level within the next few years. The dominant method to exchange synchrophasor data remains the IEEE C37.118 <sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup> protocol that was designed for and continues to be the preferred solution for substation-to-control room communications.  It achieves its advantages through use of an ordered set (a frame) of information that is associated with a specific measurement time.  When IEEE C37.118 is used for PDC-to-PDC communication or for PDC-to-Application communication, large data frames are typically distributed to multiple systems.</p>
<p>To address the challenges presented by these large IEEE C37.118 frame sizes, many utilities have implemented purpose-built networks for synchrophasor data only.  Even with these purpose-built networks, large frame sizes result in an increased probability of UDP frame loss, or in the case of TCP, increased communication latency.  In addition, IEEE C37.118 has only prescriptive methods for the management of measurement metadata which is well-suited for substation-to-control-center use but which becomes difficult to manage as this metadata spans analytic solutions and is used by multiple configuration owners in a wide-area context.</p>
<p>The Advanced Synchrophasor Protocol (ASP) Project was proposed to DOE in response to FOA-1492. In this proposal, the argument was made for a new protocol that overcomes the limitations of IEEE C37.118 for large-scale synchrophasor data system deployments.  The new publish-subscribe protocol to be developed under the ASP Project is called the Streaming Telemetry Transport Protocol (STTP).  STTP leverages the successful design elements of the secure Gateway Exchange Protocol (GEP) that was originally developed by the Grid Protection Alliance (GPA) as part of the SIEGate project (DE-OE-536).</p>
<p>On May 1, 2017, a DOE grant (DE-OE-859) was awarded to GPA and the other 25 collaborators on the ASP Project (see <a href="#contributors">Contributors</a> section) to: (1) write a detailed definition of the STTP protocol <em>(i.e., this document)</em>; (2) develop software to support it including production-grade implementations of STTP API's for multiple development platforms along with a collection of tools to test and validate STTP; and (3) demonstrate and evaluate its efficacy with multiple vendors and utilities.</p>
<h3 id="scope-of-this-document">Scope of this Document</h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is to define STTP and to include, as appendices, descriptions as to how to use its supporting software tools.  This STTP specification is focused on effective "streaming data" delivery of which synchrophasor data is a very important use case.</p>
<p>In the <a href="#protocol-overview">Protocol Overview</a> section of this specification, high-level features and the business value of STTP are presented. The balance of the sections of the specification provide the details of protocol design.</p>
<p><a href="#appendix-a---functional-requirements">Appendix A - Functional Requirements</a> provides the set of functional requirements and use cases needed for successful STTP deployment.</p>
<p><a href="#appendix-b---sttp-api-reference">Appendix B - STTP API Reference</a> provides instructions to enable software developers to integrate and use of STTP within other software systems.</p>
<p><a href="#appendix-c---ieee-c37118-mapping">Appendix C - IEEE C37.118 Mapping</a> provides a detailed look at the process of transforming IEEE C37.118 into STTP as well as creating IEEE C37.118 streams from STTP.</p>
<p><a href="#appendix-d---other-protocol-evaluations">Appendix D - Other Protocol Evaluations</a> provides insight into other protocols that were considered for suitability when developing the STTP use cases and functional requirements.</p>
<p><a href="#appendix-e---tssc-algorithm">Appendix E - TSSC Algorithm</a> provides specification details for the Time-series Special Compression Algorithm (TSSC) which is used by STTP to archive very high compression ratios for streaming data.</p>
<p>While the format and structure of this document, established to facilitate collaboration, is different than that used by standards bodies, it is hoped that the content within this document can meet all the information requirements needed to enable repackaging of this specification into draft standard formats.</p>
<h2 id="business-case">Business case</h2>
<p>At the conclusion of the ASP project in April 2019, it is anticipated that STTP will be a well-tested, thoroughly vetted, production-grade protocol that will be supported by ASP project team vendors.  An open source tool suite for STTP will be developed as part of the project (see <a href="#appendix-b---sttp-api-reference">Appendix B</a>) that will include a test harness that will allow utilities and vendors outside the project to test and validate STTP in their systems and API's.</p>
<p>STTP offers both short-term cost savings and strategic value in that it is:</p>
<h4 id="intrinsically-robust">Intrinsically Robust</h4>
<p>By design, STTP packet sizes are small and are optimized for network MTU size reducing fragmentation which results in more efficient TCP performance and less overall data loss with UDP.  STTP also puts significantly less stress on network routing equipment and facilitates mixing of streaming data traffic and other general network communications.  With STTP, purpose built networks are not required to reliably support very large phasor data streams.</p>
<h4 id="security-centric">Security Centric</h4>
<p>STTP has been built using a "security first" design approach.  Authentication to establish a connection with other parties requires a certificate.  While public certificate providers can be used, it is recommended that symmetric certificates be exchanged out-of-band to avoid the risk and cost of management of public keys. Best-practice encryption is natively available in STTP but not required given the common practice to manage encryption at the network layer.</p>
<h4 id="reduces-first-cost">Reduces First Cost</h4>
<p>A protocol similar to STTP called GEP has been measured <sup>[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</sup> to have less than half the band width requirements of IEEE C37.118 <sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup> when used with TCP and simple methods for lossless compression.  With the compression, a single signal or measurement point (i.e., an identifier, timestamp, value and quality code) requires only 2.5 bytes. By comparison, IEEE C37.118 requires 4.5 bytes per measurement on average. The signal-based GEP protocol incorporates Pub/Sub data exchange methods so that unnecessary data points need not be exchanged - thereby further reducing overall bandwidth requirements as compared to IEEE C37.118.</p>
<h4 id="reduces-operating-cost">Reduces Operating Cost</h4>
<p>STTP will automatically exchange and synchronize measurement level meta-data using a GUID as the key value to allow the self-initialization and integration of rich meta-data with points from multiple connected synchrophasor networks.  This eliminates the need to map measurements to a pre-defined set identifiers and dispenses with the cost and hassles of synchronization of individual utility configuration with a centralized registry. Permissions for data subscriptions can be grouped and filtered using expressions to assure that only the signals that are authorized are shared (for example, all phasors from a specified substation) while the set of points available is dynamically adjusted as PMUs come and go without the need for point-by-point administrator approval.</p>
<h4 id="an-enabling-technology">An Enabling Technology</h4>
<p>STTP provides an alternative to the existing method for utility data exchange that will enable future generations of SCADA/EMS systems to both (1) utilize full-resolution synchrophasor data streams and (2) significantly reduce the cost of maintaining the configuration of components to exchange other real-time data.  An ISO/RTO will typically exchange hundreds of thousands of data points every few seconds with its members and neighbors.  </p>

  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/information_source.png?v5" alt=":information_source:" title=":information_source:" class="emoji-img emoji"> ICCP (IEC 60870-6/TASE.2) is the international standard used to exchange "real-time" SCADA data among electric utilities.  Analog measurement data is typically exchanged continuously every 2 to 10 seconds with bi-modal data such as breaker status information only being exchanged "on change".  ICCP came into coordinated use in North America in the mid-1990s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Promising technologies are being developed for cloud computing and these technologies are moving toward native implementations at individual utilities and ISOs.  These cloud computing technologies can also be leveraged to support larger native implementations such as those for an interconnect.  The common theme among these technologies is the ability to process significantly more data quickly with improved reliability.</p>
<p>It's possible that a protocol like STTP which allows secure, low-latency, high-volume data exchange among utilities at low cost can be a major factor in driving change toward these new technologies. New higher-speed forms of inter-utility interaction will be possible, and new approaches for providing utility information services will be realizable.  </p>
<h4 id="built-upon-a-proven-approach">Built Upon A Proven Approach</h4>
<p>STTP will enhance the successful design elements of the Gateway Exchange Protocol (GEP) as a foundation and improve upon it. GEP is currently in production use by Dominion, Entergy, MISO, PeakRC, TVA, FP&amp;L, Southern Company, among others.</p>

<p>Code blocks are shown as:</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">    void DisplayHelloWorld()
    {
        printf("Hello World!");
    }</code></pre>
<p>Code is also shown <code>inline</code> as well.</p>
<h3 id="presentation-language">Presentation Language</h3>
<p>This specification deals with the serialization and representation of data in external contexts. To help describe the format of the data a high-level programming syntax will be used. The syntax resembles the "C" programming language, however its purpose is to be illustrative and not language accurate.</p>
<h4 id="standard-endianness">Standard Endianness</h4>
<p>Representation of all data types is explicitly specified. The most fundamental unit of data is one byte, i.e., 8-bits. Multi-byte data items are encoded as a sequence of contiguous bytes, from left to right when shown horizontally or from top to bottom when shown vertically. Unless otherwise specified, byte-ordering for encoded multi-byte values, e.g., a binary representation of integer values, will always be in big-endian order.</p>
<p>When extracted from a stream of bytes on a system whose native byte-ordering is little-endian, a multi-byte item, e.g., a 32-bit integer value, could be decoded as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">    uint32 value = buffer[0] &lt;&lt; 24 | buffer[1] &lt;&lt; 16 | buffer[2] &lt;&lt; 8 | buffer[3];</code></pre>
<h4 id="comments">Comments</h4>
<p>Code comments in this specification begin with <code>//</code> and continue to the end of the line. Optionally comments can be represented as beginning with <code>/*</code> and ending with <code>*/</code>.</p>
<h4 id="common-structures">Common Structures</h4>
<p>The following common code structures are predefined for use within other STTP protocol structures.</p>
<h5 id="version-structure">Version Structure</h5>
<p>Represents a versioned entity, e.g., a protocol version, consisting of a byte for the major and minor components of the version:</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">struct {
  uint8 major;
  uint8 minor;
}
Version;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>major</code> field defines the major component of the represented version.</li>
<li>The <code>minor</code> field defines the minor component of the represented version.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="namedversion-structure">NamedVersion Structure</h5>
<p>Represents a named entity and associated version, e.g., a compression algorithm, consisting of a <a href="#version-structure"><code>Version</code></a> and an ASCII encoded string name.</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">struct {
  uint8[20] name;
  Version version;
}
NamedVersion;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>name</code> field defines an ASCII encoded string name for this structure. Field name should be padded with spaces to the right and any serializations should not include a null terminator, i.e., a zero value character.</li>
<li>The <code>version</code> field defines a <a href="#version-structure"><code>Version</code></a> number for this structure.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/information_source.png?v5" alt=":information_source:" title=":information_source:" class="emoji-img emoji"> Small fixed string size for <code>name</code> field expected to be sufficient for foreseeable use cases, e.g., specification of compression algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="namedversions-structure">NamedVersions Structure</h5>
<p>Represents a collection of <a href="#namedversion-structure"><code>NamedVersion</code></a> entities which includes a count of the total elements.</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">struct {
  uint16 count;
  NamedVersion[] items;
}
NamedVersions;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>count</code> field defines the total number of elements in the <code>items</code> array.</li>
<li>The <code>items</code> field is an array of <a href="#namedversion-structure"><code>NamedVersion</code></a> structures.</li>

<p>STTP is an open, data point centric publish/subscribe transport protocol that can be used to securely exchange time-series style data and automatically synchronize metadata between two applications. The protocol supports sending real-time and historical data at full or down-sampled resolutions. When sending historical data, the replay speed can be controlled dynamically for use in visualizations to enable users to see data faster or slower than recorded in real-time.</p>
<p>The wire protocol employed by STTP implements a publish/subscribe data exchange model using simple commands with a compressed binary serialization of data points. The protocol does not require a predefined or fixed configuration - that is, the data points values arriving in one data packet can be different than those arriving in another. Each packet of data consists of a collection of data points where each instance is a compact structure containing an ID, a timestamp or sequence, a value and any associated flags.</p>
<p>STTP is implemented using a <em>command channel</em> and a <em>data channel</em>. The actual IP transport protocols for these channels varies based on need, but is often either a single TCP/IP transport for both the command and data channel -or- a TCP/IP based command channel with a UDP/IP based data channel.</p>
<p>The command channel is used to reliably negotiate session specific required communication, state and protocol parameters. The command channel is also used to authenticate with other STTP instances, exchange metadata on available data points, and request specific data points for subscription. The data channel is used to send compact, binary encoded packets of data points.</p>
<p>STTP includes strong access control and encryption and is configurable to allow use of private keys in a highly isolated environment. When encryption and strong identity verification is enabled, STTP utilizes standard key management services with X.509 identity certificates for authentication.</p>
<p>In this section of the STTP specification, first data communication fundamentals are presented that set the boundary conditions for protocol design. These are followed by an introduction to the major components STTP.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>In typical messaging exchange paradigms, a source application hosts a block of structured data, composed in memory, with the intent to transmit the data to one or more receiving applications. The data has <em>structure</em> in the sense that it exists as a collection of simpler primitive data types where each of the data elements is given a name to provide useful context and meaning; most programming languages represent data structures using a primary key word, e.g., <code>class</code> or <code>struct</code>. Before transmission, the data structure must be serialized - this is necessary because the programming language of the source application which hosts the data structure defines the structure in memory using a format that is optimized for use in the application. The process of serializing the data structure causes each of the data elements to be translated into a format that is easily transmitted over a network and is suitable for deserialization by a receiving application.</p>
<p>The applications that are sending and receiving data structures can be running on the same machine or on different physical hardware with disparate operating systems. As a result, the details of the data structure serialization format can be complex and diverse. Such complexities can include issues with proper handling of the endianness of the primitive data types during serialization which may differ from the system that is deserializing the data, or differences in the interpretation of how character data is encoded <sup>[<a href="#ref6">6</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The subject of serializing data structures in the field of computer science has become very mature; many solutions exist to manage the complexities of serialization. Today most computer programming languages, or their associated frameworks, include various options for serializing data structures in multiple formats. However, these solutions tend to only work within their target ecosystems and are usually not very interoperable with other frameworks or languages.</p>
<p>When interoperability is important, other technologies exist that focus on data structure serialization that works regardless of hardware, operating system or programming language. Two of these serialization technologies that are in wide use are Google Protocol Buffers <sup>[<a href="#ref7">7</a>]</sup> and the Facebook developed Apache Thrift <sup>[<a href="#ref8">8</a>]</sup>. Both of these serialization frameworks create highly compact, cross-platform serializations of data structures with APIs that exist in many commonly used programming languages.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>For smaller sized, discrete data structures, the existing available serialization technologies are very fast and highly effective. However, as the data structures become larger, the process of serialization and deserialization becomes more costly in terms of both memory allocation and computational processing. Because of this, large frames of data are not recommended for use by these serialization technologies <sup>[<a href="#ref9">9</a>]</sup> <sup>[<a href="#ref10">10</a>]</sup>. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, there are also penalties that occur at the network transport layer.</p>
<h4 id="data-structure-serialization-in-the-power-industry">Data Structure Serialization in the Power Industry</h4>
<p>In the electric power industry, the IEEE C37.118 <sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup> protocol exists as a standard serialization format for the exchange of synchrophasor data. Synchrophasor data is typically measured with an accurate time source, e.g., a GPS clock, and transmitted at high-speed data rates, up to 120 frames per second. Measured data sent by this protocol is still simply a frame of serialized primitive types which includes data elements such as a timestamp, status flags, phasor angle / magnitude pairs, etc. The IEEE C37.118 protocol also prescribes the combination of data frames received from multiple source devices for the same timestamp into one large combined frame in a process known as concentration. The concentration process demands that a waiting period be established to make sure all the expected data frames for a given timestamp arrive. If any frames of data do not arrive before the waiting period expires, the overall combined frame is published anyway. Since the frame format is fixed, empty data elements that have no defined value, e.g., NaN or null, still occupy space for the missing frames.</p>
<h3 id="large-frame-network-impact">Large Frame Network Impact</h3>
<p>Under the Internet Protocol (IP), all frames of data to be transmitted that exceed the negotiated maximum transmission unit (MTU) size (typically 1,500 bytes for Ethernet networks <sup>[<a href="#ref11">11</a>]</sup>) are divided into multiple fragments where each fragment is called a network packet, see <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>.</p>
<p><a name="figure1"></a> <center></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sttp/Specification/master/Output/Images/packet-fragmentation.png" alt="Packet Fragmentation" /></p>
<p><sup>Figure 1</sup><br />
</center></p>
<p>Since IP is inherently unreliable, the impact of large frames on an IP network can be determined by the number of network packets required to send the frame.  Network packets can only be transmitted over a connection one packet at a time; when two or more network packets arrive for transmission at the same time on any physical network media, the result is a collision. When a collision occurs, only one packet gets sent and the others get dropped <sup>[<a href="#ref12">12</a>]</sup>. IP defines a variety of different transport protocols for network packet transmission, each of which behave in different manners when dealing with packet loss. Consequently, many of the impacts a large frame has on an IP network is dependent upon the transport protocol used to send the frame.</p>
<h4 id="large-frame-impacts-on-tcpip">Large Frame Impacts on TCP/IP</h4>
<p>The most common Internet protocol, TCP/IP, creates an index for each of the network packets being sent for a frame of data and verifies that each are successfully delivered, retransmitting packets as many times as needed in the case of loss. This functionality is the basis for TCP being considered a <em>reliable</em> data transmission protocol.</p>
<p>Since each packet of data for the transmitted frame is sequentially ordered, TCP is able to fully reconstruct and deliver the original frame once all the packets have arrived. However, for very large frames of data this causes TCP to suffer from the same kinds of impacts on memory allocation and computational burden as the aforementioned serialization technologies, i.e., Protocol Buffers and Thrift. The unique distinction for IP based protocols is that at some level, these issues also affect every element of the interconnected network infrastructure between the source and sync of the data being exchanged.</p>
<p>Another critical impact that is unique to TCP is that for data that needs to be delivered in a timely fashion, retransmissions of dropped packets can also cause cumulative time delays <sup>[<a href="#ref13">13</a>]</sup>, especially as large data frames are published at rapid rates. Time delays are also exacerbated during periods of increased network activity which induces congestion and a higher rate of collisions.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/information_source.png?v5" alt=":information_source:" title=":information_source:" class="emoji-img emoji"> Synchrophasor data is the source for real-time visualization and analysis tools which are used to operate the bulk electric system (BES). This real-time data is required to be accurate, dependable and timely in order to be useful for grid operators <sup>[<a href="#ref14">14</a>]</sup>. Any delays in the delivery of this data could have adverse affects on operational decisions impacting the BES.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="large-frame-impacts-on-udpip">Large Frame Impacts on UDP/IP</h4>
<p>Another common Internet protocol is UDP/IP. Transmission of data over UDP differs from TCP in the fact that UDP does not attempt to retransmit data nor does it make any attempts to maintain the order of the transmitted packets. This functionality is the basis for UDP being considered a <em>lossy</em> data transmission protocol, but more lightweight than TCP.</p>
<p>Even with the unreliable delivery caveats, UDP will still attempt to reconstruct and deliver the originally transmitted frame of data. However, even if a single network packet is dropped, the entire original frame will be lost and any packets that were already accumulated get discarded <sup>[<a href="#ref15">15</a>]</sup>. In other words, there are no partial frame deliveries - frame reception with UDP is an all or nothing operation.</p>
<p>Since UDP attempts frame reconstruction with the received packets, the impact of large frames of data with UDP are similar to those with TCP and serialization technologies in that there is increased memory allocation and computational processing throughout the network infrastructure.</p>
<p>The more problematic impact with UDP and large frames of data is that the increased number of network packets needed to send a large frame also increases the probability of dropping one of those packets due to a collision. Since the loss of any one packet results in the loss of the entire frame of data, as frame size increases, so does volume of overall data loss.</p>
<h5 id="impacts-of-udp-loss-on-synchrophasor-data">Impacts of UDP Loss on Synchrophasor Data</h5>
<p>For synchrophasor data, UDP is often the protocol of choice. The density of synchrophasor data allows analytical applications to tolerate <em>some</em> loss. The amount of loss that can be tolerated depends on the nature of the analytic because as the loss increases, the confidence in the analytic results decreases <sup>[<a href="#references-and-notes">citation needed</a>]</sup>. Another reason UDP is used for synchrophasor data is its lightweight nature; use of UDP reduces overall network bandwidth requirements as compared to TCP <sup>[<a href="#ref16">16</a>]</sup>. Perhaps the most critical reason for use of UDP for synchrophasor data is that UDP does not suffer from issues with induced time delays caused by retransmission of dropped network packets.</p>
<p>For IEEE C37.118 <sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup> deployments, large frame sizes can have adverse affects on data completeness; as more and more devices are concentrated into a single frame of data, the larger frame sizes contribute to higher overall data losses. In tests conducted by PeakRC, measured overall data loss for the transmission of all of its synchrophasor data using IEEE C37.118 averaged over 2% <sup>[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</sup> when using a data rate of 30 frames per second and more than 3,100 data values per frame. To help mitigate the data losses when using UDP, some companies have resorted to purpose-built, dedicated synchrophasor networks <sup>[<a href="#ref17">17</a>]</sup>. Although a dedicated network is ideal at reducing data loss (minimizing simultaneous network traffic results in fewer collisions), this will not be an option for most companies that treat the network as a shared resource.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-paradigm-with-sttp">Changing the Paradigm with STTP</h3>
<p>Existing serialization technologies are not designed for messaging exchange use cases that demand sending large frames of data at high speeds, often falling short in terms of timely delivery or data loss depending on the IP transport protocol used. The obvious solution is to break large data structures into smaller ones, recombining them as needed in receiving applications <sup>[<a href="#ref9">9</a>]</sup>. Although this strategy can work fine for one-off solutions where data structures are manually partitioned into smaller units for transport, this does not lend itself to an abstract, versatile long term solution.</p>
<p>Instead of serializing an entire data structure as a unit, STTP is designed to package each of the distinct elements of the data structure into small groups. Serialization is managed for each data element, typically a primitive type, that gets individually identified along with any associated state, e.g., time and/or quality information, see <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>. Ultimately more information is being sent, but it is being packaged differently.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/information_source.png?v5" alt=":information_source:" title=":information_source:" class="emoji-img emoji"> For the purposes of this specification a data element, its identification and any associated state, e.g., time and quality, will be referred to as a <em>data point</em>.  </p>

<p><strong>Mapping Data Structure Elements to Data Points</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sttp/Specification/master/Output/Images/data-element-to-points.png" alt="Mapping Data Structure Elements to Data Points" /></p>
<p><sup>Figure 2</sup><br />
</center></p>
<p>To resolve issues with large frame impacts on IP based networks, a primary tenet of the STTP design strategy is to reduce fragmentation; as a result, STTP intentionally limits the number of data points that will be grouped together to form a frame to ensure its size is optimized for transmission over an IP network with minimal fragmentation.</p>
<p>Because each data point is uniquely identified, the elements that appear from one frame to another are not fixed allowing interleaving of data from multiple simultaneous data exchanges - this notion supports the delivery of any number of data structures where each can have a different publication interval, see <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<p><a name="figure3"></a> <center></p>

  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wrench.png?v5" alt=":wrench:" title=":wrench:" class="emoji-img emoji"> While it is possible to always target zero fragmentation by making sure the frame size is below the current MTU size, STTP implementations should allow tuning for some fragmentation to accommodate different deployment scenarios and use cases, i.e., allowing target frame sizes that are larger than the current MTU size. For deployments in high-performance network environments, overall loss due to data collisions may be statistically the same for frame sizes that are a few multiples of the MTU.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="sttp-bandwidth-impact">STTP Bandwidth Impact</h4>
<p>Since data points include identity and state along with the primitive type value, serializations of STTP data carry extra information; so by its very nature uncompressed STTP will often require more bandwidth as compared to traditional data structure serialization technologies.</p>
<p>Although it will be common for use cases that demand a protocol like STTP, e.g., transmission of large data sets with variable availability at high speeds, to be deployed in environments that are not bandwidth constrained - simple testing has shown that deviation based compression techniques that have negligible processing impact can yield overall bandwidth requirements for STTP that are equal to or less than other serialization technologies, even when carrying extra information. For synchrophasor data, tests have shown data point serializations to have less than half the bandwidth requirements of IEEE C37.118 <sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup> when used over TCP with simple stateful methods for lossless compression <sup>[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Bandwidth requirements for STTP can often be further lowered by reducing the amount of data being transmitted. For most data structure serialization technologies and protocols, the very process of packaging and sending data in the form of data structures means that some data ends up being transmitted that is not used nor needed by receiving applications. Data reduction for these technologies means creating smaller data structures where it can be costly to maintain separate configuration models for multiple data structures just to achieve bandwidth improvements. Since STTP is designed as a publish / subscribe technology, a receiving application can choose to subscribe to only the individual data points it needs.</p>
<h4 id="data-point-level-publish--subscribe">Data Point Level Publish / Subscribe</h4>
<p>STTP intrinsically manages data at its most fundamental level, primitive types. Each uniquely identified primitive type value represents some form of physical measurement. When measured with periodicity and associated with a timestamp at the moment of measurement, the resulting sequence of measured values and associated timestamps are known as <em>time series</em> data. Since data points that are serialized by STTP can include time as part the state information for a value, STTP can be considered a time series data transmission protocol. However, the state information for values being transmitted is flexible - what is <em>time</em> for one data point could simply be a <em>sequence</em> for another. Additionally, the existence of some data points can be temporal, for example, to exchange a set of binary data, a temporary data point ID may be created that only exists until the binary data transfer is complete.</p>
<p>STTP uses a publish / subscribe based model for control of the data to be exchanged. This exchange is managed at the data point level where data sourced at a sending application, i.e., the <em>publisher</em>, will make a set of data points available for publication. A receiving application, i.e., the <em>subscriber</em>, will select a subset of the available points for subscription. As new data is made available at the publisher, the subset of the data as selected by the subscriber will be transmitted.</p>
<h5 id="data-point-metadata">Data Point Metadata</h5>
<p>A critical part of the publish / subscribe process is defining the data points that are available for subscription. An STTP publisher will define a tabular list of available data point identifiers and associated descriptive information as the <em>metadata</em> that is available to a subscriber.</p>
<p>Each data point includes a unique identifier; regardless of the binary transmission format, this identifier will exist as a statistically unique GUID in the defined metadata for the available data points. This makes the metadata from multiple publishers easier to merge into local repositories used by a subscriber.</p>
<p>At a minimum, each row in the STTP publisher metadata will include the GUID based data point identifier, a short human readable alpha-numeric <em>tag</em>, the primitive data type used for the value of the data point, a description, the enabled state and timestamps for the creation, last update and deletion of the data point.</p>
<p>Metadata in STTP is designed to be extensible. Different industries may require different kinds of available metadata in order to properly map and integrate with other protocols and environments. To accommodate the extensibility, other tabular datasets can be made available by a publisher as needed.</p>
<h5 id="data-point-access-control">Data Point Access Control</h5>
<p>STTP puts publishers in full control of access to data. A publisher can choose not to allow connections and/or expose any data to a subscriber that is not strongly identified. Publishers can choose to restrict data access at an individual data point level, a group level or at an identified subscriber level.</p>
<p>Selection of available points for an identified subscriber or a group can be controlled by an expression. Expression based access control means that the even as the data sources available to a publisher change, the expressions will still apply and need not be updated. For example, metadata will need to contain information about the primitive data type for a given data point - an expression based on this data type may look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>ALLOW WHERE DataType='BOOL'</code></pre>
<p>For this expression, all data points as defined in the metadata that have a data type of <code>BOOL</code> would be allowed for the group or identified subscriber. This expression would cause the allowed metadata to dynamically change as the available source data configured in the publisher changed.</p>
<h4 id="data-transport-channels">Data Transport Channels</h4>
<p>Although not precluded from use over other data transports, the design of STTP is targeted and optimized for use over IP, specifically TCP/IP and UDP/IP. Even so, since the command/response implementation and data packet distribution of the STTP protocol is fairly simple, it is expected that commonly available middleware data transport layers, such as ZeroMQ or DDS, could easily support and transmit data using the STTP protocol should any of the messaging distribution and management benefits of these transport layers be useful to a particular deployment environment. However, these types of deployments are outside the scope of this documentation. If needed, STTP integrations with middleware layers should be added as reference implementation repositories to the STTP organizational site <sup>[<a href="#ref4">4</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="establishing-connections">Establishing Connections</h2>
<p>It is expected that STTP will normally be used over Internet Protocol. In order to meet the entire set of capabilities as enumerated in this specification, a TCP/IP based connection will be required. For simple STTP configurations, a single established TCP connection can be used to meet the requirements for both the <em>command channel</em> and <em>data channel</em> functions. Connections using UDP/IP can also be configured for data channel functions when used in conjunction with a TCP based command channel, however, use of UDP connections for STTP data transmission reduces the set of capabilities that can be supported. As an example, since UDP is a lossy transmission protocol, its use means that transmitted data can be dropped, so any capabilities that implement stateful compression and require delivery guarantees cannot be supported.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/information_source.png?v5" alt=":information_source:" title=":information_source:" class="emoji-img emoji"> UDP only style deliveries, either unicast or multicast, of data using STTP can only be accommodated with substantial capability restrictions. That is, with no reliable command channel, consumers of STTP data provided over a UDP only connection would be subject to publisher established formats, content and resolution of the data being delivered. Alternately, establishment of a UDP based command channel would require adjustments in protocol behavior to accommodate failures to send command requests and/or receive responses due to lack of delivery guarantees.  While it is expected that with the right set of initial assumptions and capability restrictions that STTP could effectively operate with a UDP only connection, the main text of this specification will intentionally remain silent on such details for the sake of simplicity, clarity and brevity.</p>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/construction.png?v5" alt=":construction:" title=":construction:" class="emoji-img emoji"> Add an appendix to discuss how a UDP only STTP transmission should work so that needed caveats and capability restrictions can be established for this behavior. Describing this operation is important given that UDP only data transmissions for synchrophasors is widely used in production environments today. UDP only deployments, e.g., multicast, can also be very useful in lab environments for simplicity in data distribution. Regardless of the veracity and logic for the technical arguments that can be made to not use UDP, either by itself or in combination with TCP, by not defining the protocol behavior in these modes of operation there is increased risk of the protocol not being initially adopted or accepted. Having these behaviors documented will help alleviate any non-standard implementations that may crop up otherwise. Reference implementations will be adjusted to accommodate these use-cases as time allows, however UDP options will be implemented at lower priority. During code development, UDP use cases will be kept in-mind such that future iterations of the reference implementations can accommodate UDP based behaviors and functionality more readily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All STTP connections will be established using standard IP sockets. The actual details of establishing a socket connection are specific to an operating system and ultimately the programming language being used. However, the minimum information needed to create a socket is (1) an endpoint, i.e., the IP address and port number, (2) the desired IP transport protocol, e.g., TCP or UDP, and (3) the type connection to be established, i.e., a <em>server-style</em> socket or a <em>client-style</em> socket. A server-style socket is one that will listen for connections from clients. A client-style socket is one that will connect to a listening server socket. Client-style sockets are always the <em>initiators</em> of any given connection, i.e., client sockets always "make the call" to server sockets to begin communications.</p>
<h3 id="forward-connections">Forward Connections</h3>
<p>Under typical conditions STTP publishers, as data providers, will use server-style listening sockets, and STTP subscribers, as data consumers, will use client-style sockets to initiate connections to a publisher's listening socket. Establishing a server-style socket for a publisher and client-style sockets for any subscribers describes a connectivity model for STTP that is called a <em>forward connection</em>. Forward connections are expected to be the normal use case for STTP publisher/subscriber connections. However, for an STTP connection it does not matter which party, publisher or subscriber, is the server or the client from a socket perspective.</p>
<h3 id="reverse-connections">Reverse Connections</h3>
<p>In STTP it is perfectly valid for a publisher to initiate a client-style socket connection to a subscriber that is listening with an established server-style socket. This type of connectivity model is called a <em>reverse connection</em>. Since a client-style connection is the only type of socket that can initiate a connection, a reverse connection requires the publisher to be the initiator of a connection such that the target subscriber would be able to receive data.</p>
<p>Reverse connections flip the normal responsibilities of a publish/subscribe messaging pattern by having parties that provision the data also the be the initiators of a connection. Data subscribers, which might otherwise come and go as needed, now become a persistent network resource that needs to be readily available for a connection from its publisher. Reverse connections can require more data flow planning and network engineering to ensure that connections are initiated from the proper locations while having the data reliably flow to the desired locations.</p>
<p>Regardless of how a connection is established, forward or reverse, the functions, roles and responsibilities of the participants will not change, i.e., a publisher will still be the provider of data and the subscriber will still be the consumer of data. Additionally, any required protocol negotiations by the parties will continue as normal once the connection has been established.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/information_source.png?v5" alt=":information_source:" title=":information_source:" class="emoji-img emoji"> Increased flexibility in the connectivity models for STTP is necessary so that security boundaries that have been enforced with firewall rules can be maintained. A common use case is that the publisher, and the data it is has access to, will exist in a secure network environment and the subscribers, which need access to the data, will exist in less secure network environments. In these scenarios, firewall rules will prohibit any connections to be initiated from an environment that is considered to be less secure. However, such environments normally allow connections to be initiated from inside the secure environment out to listening connections in less secure environments. Described more simply, nothing can reach in to systems in the secure environment, but systems in the secure environment can reach out - this is much like how a computer in a home network can access the public Internet through a router, but the router's built-in firewall prevents systems on the Internet from accessing the home computer. Although reverse connections may initially seem counter-intuitive, they exist as a firm STTP requirement to allow for successful data exchange from within secure environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="bidirectional-data-exchange">Bidirectional Data Exchange</h3>
<p>For simple TCP only based connectivity configurations, once a connection has been established between two systems a communications pathway will exist such that data can flow bidirectionally. This is true regardless of which party uses a client or server socket or the connectivity model in use, i.e., a forward or reverse connection.</p>
<p>Since data in a TCP based connection can easily move in both directions, both parties can simultaneously enable both publisher and subscriber functions. This allows STTP to be used in a data exchange <em>gateway</em> capacity allowing for bidirectional data exchange with simplified connectivity requirements. The only decision two parties would need to make in this mode of operation is which STTP instance will act as a server and which instance will act as a client.</p>
<p>More traditional configuration models can be established for bidirectional data exchange as well, such as, restricting server-style sockets to publisher functions with connecting client-style sockets restricted to subscriber functions. In this configuration, both parties would have listening server-style sockets for publisher functions and both would need to establish client-style sockets for subscriber functions. This may be the preferred mode of operation when one or more parties want to have more control over subscriber connectivity and security, or desire to use UDP for data transmission.</p>
<h3 id="using-udp-for-data-transmission">Using UDP for Data Transmission</h3>
<p>By reducing the STTP capability set to functions that support lossy data transmission, data channel functionality in STTP can be established over a UDP connection. When using a UDP based data channel, command channel functionality is expected be established over a TCP connection. A reliable command channel is needed in order to properly manage initial protocol negotiations, which includes establishing the operational modes of the publisher/subscriber connection, and provides the ability for subscribers to choose the data to be received.</p>
<p>STTP data channel functionality is designed to be sent without the expectation of a response in order to accommodate connections that have unidirectional data flows, such as UDP. Any functionality related to transmitted data that requires a response, e.g., a delivery receipt, will be managed by the command channel.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wrench.png?v5" alt=":wrench:" title=":wrench:" class="emoji-img emoji"> The initial subscriber command request sent to a publisher should include the UDP port that the subscriber wishes the publisher to use. The destination UDP port is a local resource for the subscriber host machine and therefore under its control.

</blockquote>
<h3 id="secure-connections">Secure Connections</h3>
<p>For data transmissions over the Internet or those that need to transmit sensitive data, a secured socket connection will need to be established for STTP communications. To secure a connection, a socket will be established with standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) using a signed X.509 certificate. TLS will be used to encrypt, authenticate and attest to the integrity of the data being transmitted over STTP.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wrench.png?v5" alt=":wrench:" title=":wrench:" class="emoji-img emoji"> As of the writing of this specification, the latest available TLS version is 1.2, with the 1.3 version still in draft. The default stance for STTP implementations is to always default to the latest, hence most secure, version of TLS available. However, since different operating systems and programming languages may not be up-to-date with the latest TLS versions and different implementations of STTP need to be interoperable, the TLS version to use for any publisher/subscriber connection should be configurable. However, STTP implementations should log a warning if a connection is established using a version of TLS that is less than the latest supported version for the implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TLS is a protocol layer that sits above TCP, as a result, secure connections will be established in exactly the same manner as basic TCP connections, however once the socket is connected, TLS will add the needed negotiations to enable security. Just like with a socket, the actual details of establishing a secure TLS session are specific to an operating system and ultimately the programming language being used.</p>
<h4 id="certificate-validation">Certificate Validation</h4>
<p>The use of X.509 certificates are required in order to secure an STTP connection using TLS. For STTP, certificates are used to verify the identity of a connection, as well as to provide data encryption and integrity guarantees. For confidence in the certificates being used, STTP defines the operations needed to ensure that certificates are valid.</p>
<p>STTP implementations should have the capability to use either self-signed certificates or those signed by a certificate authority (CA). For CA issued certificates, trust is delegated to the CA, which normally means the CA will need to be accessible during the validation process.</p>
<p>For self-signed certificates, trust will exist between the two parties exchanging certificates, which means each party will need to agree to keep the certificates private and to notify the other party if the host machine is ever known to be compromised, i.e., where an external party may have been able to gain access to the private keys stored for the certificate. Since trust for self-signed certificates is between the two parties exchanging data, STTP requires that the certificates be exchanged in advance - a self-signed cert sent during TLS negotiations will be considered untrusted. Self-signed certificates should always be exchanged out-of-band, i.e., not over the STTP protocol, and should never include the private keys.</p>
<p>Certificate validation is handled in terms of the type of socket connection that is established, i.e., a client-style socket or a server style-socket. The STTP functional role of the party, i.e., publisher or subscriber, does not affect the certificate validation process because both client and server style connections can be setup to validate certificates. Consequently a publisher can validate subscriber certificates and a subscriber can validate its publisher certificate regardless of which connectivity model in use, forward or reverse.</p>

  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wrench.png?v5" alt=":wrench:" title=":wrench:" class="emoji-img emoji"> Through configuration, STTP implementations should be able to gracefully accommodate use cases where the certificate validation steps encounter errors, e.g., self-signed certificates returning an expected untrusted root error or a common name mismatch error <sup>[<a href="#ref18">18</a>]</sup>. This is important since STTP can be deployed in environments where there is no public Internet access or where a client connection may appear to have a mismatched IP addresses due to a difference caused by NAT configuration. Certificate error conditions such as the inability to verify hostnames, IP addresses or contact an issuing CA should be mitigatable through configuration of the STTP implementation. For user interfaces, appropriate warnings and feedback should be provided as to the possible impact on security when errors are suppressed. Any new configurations should always default to the highest level of security and error warnings but be easily adjustable for any given environment as deemed appropriate by a user.</p>

<h5 id="client-certificate-validation">Client Certificate Validation</h5>
<p>For server certificates issued by a CA that need validation, STTP implementations should support traditional client-style connections with TLS similar to how a browser connects to a secure site with HTTPS and validates the site's certificate. In this mode, when an STTP client-style socket connects to a server-style socket that has a CA issued certificate, with the certificate being provided by the server as part of the data in the TLS negotiation process, the client will validate the server's certificate by (1) verifying the certificate's signature, (2) ensuring the certificate has not been revoked by checking the certificate revocation lists, and (3) checking that the information in the certificate information is valid, i.e., validating that one of the hostnames or IP addresses listed in the certificate subject field match the connection information for the server.</p>
<p>Validation of self-signed server certificates are similar to those for CA signed certificates but does not include steps that engage a CA. In this mode, when an STTP client-style socket connects to a server-style socket that has a self-signed certificate, the client will validate the server's certificate by (1) verifying the certificate's signature, and (2) checking that the information in the certificate is valid, i.e., validating that one of the hostnames or IP addresses listed in the certificate subject field match the connection information for the server.</p>
<h5 id="server-certificate-validation">Server Certificate Validation</h5>
<p>STTP implementations should support server-style connections with TLS with the ability to validate client certificates issued by a CA. In this mode, when an STTP server-style socket accepts a connection from a client-style socket that has a CA issued certificate, with the certificate being provided by the client as part of the data in the TLS negotiation process, the server will validate the client's certificate by (1) verifying the certificate's signature, (2) ensuring the certificate has not been revoked by checking the certificate revocation lists, and (3) checking that the information in the certificate information is valid, i.e., validating that one of the hostnames or IP addresses listed in the certificate subject field match the connection information for the client.</p>

<h4 id="udp-security-with-secure-connections">UDP Security with Secure Connections</h4>
<p>When a UDP data channel is in use and needs to be secured, it is expected that it will be associated with a command channel that is secured using TLS. With communications for the command channel already secured, it will be safe to exchange encryption keys that can be used to secure the UDP traffic.</p>
<p>STTP will secure UDP traffic using the AES encryption algorithm and a 256-bit publisher generated symmetric encryption key that will be provided to the subscriber over the TLS secured command channel.</p>

However, as of the writing of this specification, DTLS implementations were not widely available on the platforms and programming languages that were being targeted for initial STTP reference implementations.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="commands-and-responses">Commands and Responses</h2>
<p>STTP is implemented using functionality called the <em>command channel</em> that is used to reliably negotiate session specific required communication, state and protocol parameters. Command channel functionality includes establishing communications with other STTP implementations, exchanging metadata on available data points and the ability to request data points for subscription. Any messages, such as commands, transmitted with the expectation of receiving a response will only be sent over the command channel, as such this functionality requires a reliable transmission protocol, e.g., TCP.</p>
<p>STTP also defines functionality which is used to send messages without an expectation of receiving a response called the <em>data channel</em>. This functionality allows for transmission of messages over a lossy protocol, e.g., UDP. Data channel functionality is used to send compact, binary encoded data points of identifiable measured values along with timestamps accurate to one ten-millionth of a second and flags that can be used to indicate time and data quality.</p>
<p>This section describes the available commands and responses that define the functionality of STTP.</p>
<h3 id="message-formats">Message Formats</h3>
<p>Commands and responses are defined as simple binary message structures that include a payload. The details for the payload of the message will depend on the specific command or response code.</p>
<h4 id="message-payloads">Message Payloads</h4>
<p>Payloads in STTP are defined as a byte arrays prefixed by an unsigned 16-bit integer representing the array length. Implementations of STTP should make target payload sizes configurable, but all payloads delivered by STTP must have a fixed maximum upper length of <code>2^14</code>, i.e., <code>16,384</code>, bytes.</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">  uint16 length;
  uint8[] payload;</code></pre>
<p>Empty payloads have a <code>length</code> value of <code>0</code> and a <code>payload</code> value of <code>null</code>. When serialized, an empty payload would be represented by only a <code>0x00</code> value for the length.</p>
<h4 id="command-structure">Command Structure</h4>
<p>Commands are used to manage primary STTP functionality. The following defines the binary format of a <code>Command</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">struct {
  uint8 commandCode;
  uint16 length;
  uint8[] payload;
}
Command;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>commandCode</code> field defines the command code value for the command message, see defined <a href="Commands.md#commands">command codes</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>length</code> field defines the length of the <code>payload</code> in bytes.</li>
<li>The <code>payload</code> field is a byte array representing the serialized payload associated with the <code>commandCode</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="response-structure">Response Structure</h4>
<p>Responses for most commands will be either <code>Succeeded</code> to <code>Failed</code>. The following structure defines the binary format of a <code>Response</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">struct {
  uint8 responsecode;
  uint8 commandCode;
  uint16 length;
  uint8[] payload;
}
Response;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>responseCode</code> field defines the response code value for the response message, see defined <a href="Responses.md#responses">response codes</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>commandCode</code> field defines the command code value that this message is in response to, see defined <a href="Commands.md#commands">command codes</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>length</code> field defines the length of the <code>payload</code> in bytes.</li>
<li>The <code>payload</code> field is a byte array representing the serialized payload associated with the <code>responseCode</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="commands">Commands</h3>
<p>The following table defines the commands available to STTP. Commands that expect a response define the command channel functions, those that do not define the data channel functions.</p>

Strings could be used to identify commands as you suggest which might make the wire protocol more human readable, but this seems to have limited value. The benefit of allowing unlimited user commands in the protocol raises many questions in my opinion, any at all opens the possibility of introducing security issues for implementations of the protocol, a separate discussion all together. Perhaps the fundamental question is if allowing the flexibility for STTP implementations to create their own set of low level commands simply for the purposes of RPC is a worthwhile endeavor within the defined scope of the protocol. So if the protocol is designed to exchange time-series data and meta-data then what is the minimum set of commands need to accomplish this task? The original HTTP specification defined three commands GET, POST and HEAD - later versions added a few more, but the others are rarely used. HTTP accomplishes much more than its original design intentions with these three simple commands. The limited set of commands keeps the basic protocol functionality very simple, but does not limit its overall functionality. Most of the "functionality" provided through HTTP happens at a layer that exists above the wire protocol layer. I think the same can be true with STTP, i.e., functionality can be extended at an application and API layer above the wire protocol, even within the constraints of the defined commands.</em></p>

<h4 id="negotiate-session-command">Negotiate Session Command</h4>
<p>After a successful connection has been established, the publisher and subscriber will participate in an initial set of negotiations that will determine the STTP protocol version and operational modes of the session. The negotiation happens with the <code>NegotiateSession</code> command code which will be the first command sent after a successful publisher/subscriber connection. The command is sent before any other commands or responses are exchanged so that the "ground-rules" for the communications session can be established. Once the sessions negotiations for the protocol version and operational modes have been established they will not change for the lifetime of the session.</p>
<p>Session negotiation is a multi-step process with commands and responses being sent by the publisher and subscriber until negotiation terms are either established or the connection is terminated because terms could not be agreed upon.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Future STTP protocol versions can include different session negotiation options, so the first session negotiation step is always to establish the protocol version to use. Immediately after connecting, the publisher will start the protocol version negotiation process by sending the <code>NegotiateSession</code> command to the subscriber that will contain information on the available protocol versions that the publisher supports. The subscriber will be waiting for this initial publisher command; if the subscriber does not receive the command in a timely fashion (time interval controlled by configuration), the subscriber will disconnect.</p>
<p>The payload of the first <code>NegotiateSession</code> command sent by the publisher will be an instance of the <code>ProtocolVersions</code> structure, defined as follows, that iterates the versions of the STTP protocol that are supported:</p>
<pre><code class="C language-C">struct {
  uint8 count;
  Version[] versions;
}
ProtocolVersions;</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>count</code> field defines the total number of elements in the <code>versions</code> field array.</li>
<li>The <code>versions</code> field is an array of <a href="Definitions.md#version-structure"><code>Version</code></a> structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the current version of this specification only defines details for version 1.0 of STTP, the initial <code>NegotiateSession</code> command payload from the publisher will be an instance of the <code>ProtocolVersions</code> structure with a <code>count</code> value of <code>1</code> and a single element <code>versions</code> array where <code>versions[0].major</code> is <code>1</code> and <code>versions[0].minor</code> is <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>When the first <code>NegotiateSession</code> command is received from the publisher, the subscriber will send either a <code>Succeeded</code> or <code>Failed</code> response for the <code>NegotiateSession</code> command indicating its ability to support one of the specified protocol versions.</p>
<p>If the subscriber can support one of the protocols specified by the publisher, the <code>Succeeded</code> response payload will be an instance of the <code>ProtocolVersions</code> structure with a <code>count</code> of <code>1</code> and a single element <code>versions</code> array that indicates the protocol version to be used.</p>
<p>If the subscriber cannot support one of the protocols specified by the publisher, the <code>Failed</code> response payload will be an instance of the <code>ProtocolVersions</code> structure filled out with the supported protocols. In case of failure, both the publisher and subscriber should terminate the connection since no protocol version could be agreed upon.</p>
<p>When a <code>Succeeded</code> response for the first <code>NegotiateSession</code> command is received from the subscriber, the publisher will validate the subscriber selected protocol version. If the publisher does not agree with the protocol version selected by the subscriber, the publisher will send a <code>Failed</code> response for the <code>NegotiateSession</code> command with an empty payload and terminate the connection since no protocol version could be agreed upon. If the publisher accepts the subscriber selected protocol version, the negotiation will continue with the selection of operational modes.</p>
<p>After sending a <code>Succeeded</code> response to the first <code>NegotiateSession</code> command, the subscriber will be waiting for either a <code>Failed</code> response from the publisher or the second <code>NegotiateSession</code> command; if the subscriber does not receive a command or response in a timely fashion (time interval controlled by configuration), the subscriber will disconnect.</p>
<h5 id="operational-modes-negotiation">Operational Modes Negotiation</h5>
<p>For version <code>1.0</code> of STTP, if the protocol version negotiation step succeeds, the next negotiation will be for the desired operational modes. The payload of the second <code>NegotiateSession</code> command sent by the publisher will be an instance of the <code>OperationalModes</code> structure, defined as follows, that iterates the supported string encodings, if UDP broadcasts are allowed and available stateful and stateless compression algorithms (see <a href="Compression.md#compression">Compression Algorithms</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>encodings</code> field defines a set of string encodings supported by the publisher, this is a bit flag that indicates each of the supported string encodings.</li>
<li>The <code>udpPort</code> field meaning depends on the usage context:<ul>
<li>When sent with the publisher command payload, field is used to indicate publisher support of UDP. A value of zero indicates that UDP broadcasts are not supported and any non-zero value indicates that UDP broadcasts are supported.</li>
<li>When sent with the subscriber response payload, field is used to indicate the desired subscriber UDP port for data channel functionality. A value of zero will indicate that a UDP connection should not be established for subscriber data channel functionality.</li></ul></li>
<li>The <code>statefulCompressionAlgorithms</code> field defines the <a href="Definitions.md#namedversions-structure"><code>NamedVersions</code></a> representing the algorithms to use for stateful compression operations.</li>
<li>The <code>statelessCompressionAlgorithms</code> field defines the <a href="Definitions.md#namedversions-structure"><code>NamedVersions</code></a> representing the algorithms to use for stateless compression operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the second <code>NegotiateSession</code> command is received from the publisher, the subscriber will send either a <code>Succeeded</code> or <code>Failed</code> response for the <code>NegotiateSession</code> command indicating its ability to support a subset of the specified operational modes.</p>
<p>If the subscriber can support a subset of the operational modes allowed by the publisher, the <code>Succeeded</code> response payload will be an instance of the <code>OperationalModes</code> structure with the specific values for the <code>encodings</code>, <code>udpPort</code>, <code>statefulCompressionAlgorithms</code> and <code>statelessCompressionAlgorithms</code> fields. The <code>encodings</code> field should specify a single flag designating the string encoding to use and both the <code>statefulCompressionAlgorithms</code> and <code>statelessCompressionAlgorithms</code> fields should define a <code>count</code> of <code>1</code> and a single element array that indicates the <a href="Compression.md#compression">compression algorithm</a> to be used where a named value of <code>NONE</code> with a version of <code>0.0</code> indicates that no compression should be used.</p>
<p>If the subscriber cannot support a subset of the operational modes allowed by the publisher, the <code>Failed</code> response payload will be an instance of the <code>OperationalModes</code> structure filled out with the supported operational modes. In case of failure, both the publisher and subscriber should terminate the connection since no protocol version could be agreed upon.</p>
<p>When a <code>Succeeded</code> response for the second <code>NegotiateSession</code> command is received from the subscriber, the publisher will validate the subscriber selected operational modes. If the publisher does not agree with the operational modes selected by the subscriber, the publisher will send a <code>Failed</code> response for the <code>NegotiateSession</code> command with an empty payload and terminate the connection since no operational modes could be agreed upon. If the publisher accepts the subscriber selected operational modes, then the publisher will send a <code>Succeeded</code> response for the <code>NegotiateSession</code> command with an empty payload and the publisher will consider the session negotiations to be completed successfully.</p>
<p>After sending a <code>Succeeded</code> response to the second <code>NegotiateSession</code> command, the subscriber will be waiting for either a <code>Succeeded</code> or <code>Failed</code> response from the publisher; if the subscriber does not receive a response in a timely fashion (time interval controlled by configuration), the subscriber will disconnect.</p>

<p>Upon reception of the <code>Unsubscribe</code> command from a subscriber, the publisher will immediately cease publication of <code>DataPointPacket</code> commands to the specific subscriber that issued the command; also, the publisher will send a <code>Succeeded</code> response for the <code>Unsubscribe</code> command with an empty payload. If for any reason the publisher cannot terminate the subscription, the publisher will send a <code>Failed</code> response for the <code>Unsubscribe</code> command with a string based payload, encoded according to the pre-negotiated subscriber string encoding, that describes the reason the subscription cannot be terminated.</p>
<p>After sending an <code>Unsubscribe</code> command to the publisher, the subscriber will be waiting for either a <code>Succeeded</code> or <code>Failed</code> response from the publisher; if the subscriber does not receive a response in a timely fashion (time interval controlled by configuration), the subscriber should disconnect and not attempt to send further commands to stop the data subscription.</p>
<p>If the subscriber receives a <code>Failed</code> response for the <code>Unsubscribe</code> command from the publisher, the subscriber should disconnect and not attempt to send further commands to stop the data subscription.</p>
<p>Upon reception of a <code>Succeeded</code> response for the <code>Unsubscribe</code> command from the publisher, the subscriber should consider any cached signal mapping previously received from the publisher to now be invalid - accordingly any allocated memory for the cache should now be released.</p>

<h4 id="noop-command">NoOp Command</h4>
<p>When data channel functions are operating over a lossy communications protocol, e.g., UDP, and command channel functions are operating over a reliable communications protocol, e.g., TCP, then command channel activity may remain quiet for some time. To make sure the connection for the command channel is still established the <code>NoOp</code> command allows for a periodic test of connectivity.</p>
<p>The <code>NoOp</code> command will be initiated by either the publisher or subscriber, in this case the command <em>sender</em>, whereby the other party will be the command <em>receiver</em>. The <code>NoOp</code> command is always sent with an empty payload and is designed to be sent over a reliable communications channel, e.g., TCP, on a configurable schedule.</p>
<p>Upon reception of the <code>NoOp</code> command from a sender, the receiver will send a <code>Succeeded</code> response for the <code>NoOp</code> command with an empty payload.</p>
<p>After sending an <code>NoOp</code> command to the receiver, the sender will be waiting for a <code>Succeeded</code> response from the receiver; if the sender does not receive a response in a timely fashion (time interval controlled by configuration), the sender will disconnect. If the sender uses a client-style socket, the sender should reestablish the connection cycle.</p>
<p>Upon reception of a <code>Succeeded</code> response for the <code>NoOp</code> command from the receiver, the sender should consider the connection valid and reset the timer for the next <code>NoOp</code> test.</p>
<blockquote>

Instead, the Data Point Structure should be more like:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>C37.118 Data Point Structure</li>
  <li>DNP Data Point Structure</li>
  <li>ICCP Data Point Structure</li>
  <li>IEC 61850-90-5 Data Point Structure</li>
  <li>Generic Time-Series Data Point Structure (Original Data Point Structure listed above)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At some level, all measurements can be mapped to Generic Time-Series Data Point Structure, but they shouldn't be required to be from the get-go. This would allow the creation of a front-end data transport that could move any kind of time series data in its raw format and the consumer of the data can decide how to translate the data. This also means that these raw protocols could be encapsulated and transported over encrypted channels without requiring a stateful metadata repository to map all measurements to a GUID.</p>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/thumbsup.png?v5" alt=":thumbsup:" title=":thumbsup:" class="emoji-img emoji"> JRC: I think this could be supported in an automated process (and perhaps starting with code) found in serialization technologies like Google Protocol Buffers. The openECA style data structure handling has been on my mind as a way to handle "mappings" of other protocols, basically as data structures like you mention. Cannot get away from some sort of Identification of the "instance" of a mapping though - even if the mapping ID defaulted to something simple. At a wire protocol level though, sticking to primitive types helps keep protocol parsing very simple - and- there are just too many other technologies that already exist to serialize data structures- STTP should not be trying to re-solve that problem. A consumer of STTP should be able to parse any packet of data even when what the data represented was unknown.</p>

<h2 id="data-point-characteristics">Data Point Characteristics</h2>
<p>STTP will allow the ability to define delivery and quality of service characteristics for each data point made available for publication. These characteristics include priority, reliability, verification, exception and resolution.</p>
<p>The publisher is in full control of what per data point delivery characteristics are allowed. The transport layers in use for the connection will also dictate the availability of some characteristics, e.g., reliability. Regardless, the subscriber can always request a specific set of per data point delivery characteristics, but these may be denied by the publisher.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/construction.png?v5" alt=":construction:" title=":construction:" class="emoji-img emoji"> Once defined, reference associated command / response details that define the negotiations for data point delivery characteristics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The delivery characteristics for each data point have been defined to fit within a single byte. Default delivery characteristics will be assumed during subscription initialization for data points when none are otherwise defined, i.e., data point delivery characteristic flags value will be 0x00.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/construction.png?v5" alt=":construction:" title=":construction:" class="emoji-img emoji"> As an optimization, subscribers need to be able to group multiple delivery characteristic requests into a single message with an optimized payload size since request could be sizable for a very large number of data points. Same goes for any publisher response payloads.</p>
  <p>Since publisher will be able to reject, en masse, subscriber requested data point delivery characteristics, there will need to be a way in the publisher configuration to define the required and allowable characteristics for each data point.</p>
  <p>Another consideration is that it may be desirable that these configurations be changeable per subscriber. For example, user may want to require that a subscriber with a known slow connection to be forced to use an alternate lossy data communications channel for streaming data point values that can tolerate loss, but allow command communications channel for all data for subscribers using more reliable connections.</p>
  <p>Publisher configuration could be greatly simplified (possibly reduced) if data points can be assigned as required and allowable characteristics based on some automated high-level data point classification, such as, data points that can tolerate loss (streaming) or data points that require verification (control / critical).</p>
  <p>Overall thoughts on data point delivery characteristics are that since publisher is exclusively in control of delivery requirements from both a "required" and "allowed" perspective – to reduce negotiations, publisher should provide the required and allowed characteristics with the meta-data that is provided to the subscriber – this way subscriber won't inadvertently request something that is not allowed.</p>

<h3 id="priority-characteristic">Priority Characteristic</h3>
<p>Per data point subscriber request will assign data point level routing priority at the publisher. All priority values will be specific to each subscription.</p>
<h4 id="flag-definition">Flag Definition</h4>
<p>Three-bit value defining 8 priorities, i.e., 0 to 7, where 0, default, is the lowest priority and 7 is the highest priority. Note that value 7 is a reserved system-level priority, leaving a total of 7, ranging from 0 to 6, user-level priorities. Data point priority value occupies bits 0 to 2 of the data point delivery characteristic flags where the unsigned 3-bit integer is encoded in big-endian order.</p>
<h4 id="rights-and-responsibilities">Rights and Responsibilities</h4>
<p>Publisher will have the right to reject subscriber requested priority levels. If publisher rejects requested priority levels, then failure response to subscriber will include assigned levels for each data point so that subscriber can accept and update its run-time priority levels with those proposed by publisher or otherwise terminate the connection.</p>
<p>Subscriber can request desired priority levels but is subject to publisher assigned levels. A common use case may be that data points with the verification characteristic enabled will also be requested to use higher priority levels. If the subscriber does not agree with assigned data point priority levels then, with appropriate response before termination, the subscriber will close the connection.</p>

<p>Subscriber can request desired reliability values but is subject to publisher assigned values. A common use case may be that typical streaming data that can tolerate loss be restricted by the publisher to a lossy data communications channel, e.g., UDP, to reduce possibility of command communications channel queuing over slow or noisy connections. If the subscriber does not agree with assigned data point reliability values then, with appropriate response before termination, the subscriber will close the connection.</p>

<h3 id="verification-characteristic">Verification Characteristic</h3>
<p>Per data point publisher assigned characteristic will inform subscriber that a reply must be provided with receipt of data point delivery. Failure to receive receipt, within configured timeout of sender, will be exposed via API so that host application can manage any appropriate action, e.g., exception logging and/or queue for retry.  It is expected that verified data points only be used for sending critical data, either from subscriber to publisher or publisher to subscriber, e.g., a control value that will require verification of receipt.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Data point verification functions must exist in both publisher and subscriber. In the case of the subscriber, critical data points sent from publisher that are marked with a verification characteristic must be replied to with a verification message upon receipt of value. For the publisher, data points can be made available that are updatable by the subscriber, e.g., write registers or data points used for control – when these data points are marked with a verification characteristic, the publisher will reply to subscriber with a verification message upon receipt of value.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/wrench.png?v5" alt=":wrench:" title=":wrench:" class="emoji-img emoji"> End users managing publisher configuration should be made aware of the implications of requiring data point delivery verification, e.g., increased bi-directional bandwidth requirements as well as induced data point latencies because of round-trip confirmation messages – this awareness is needed so that verification characteristics are applied judiciously.

<p>Single bit value where 0, default, is data point received receipt is not required and 1 is data point received receipt is required. Data point verification value occupies bit 4 of the data point delivery characteristic flags.</p>
<h4 id="rights-and-responsibilities-2">Rights and Responsibilities</h4>
<p>Publisher has full authority over determination of which data points require verification. Any verification flags that may be specified by subscriber during data point delivery characteristic requests will be ignored. Subject to rights verification of subscriber to send data points back to publisher, any data points destined to publisher that are marked for verification must respond with a verification receipt back to subscriber upon successful delivery.</p>
<p>Subscriber must reply to publisher upon receipt of data points that are marked for verification. If the subscriber does not agree with the volume of subscribed data points that require verification then, with appropriate response before termination, the subscriber can terminate the connection. For example, if publisher specifies verification for a large volume of the subscribed data points, this may exceed subscriber's configured upload bandwidth and connection will need to be terminated.</p>

<h3 id="exception-characteristic">Exception Characteristic</h3>
<p>Per data point subscriber request would have publisher either always send data points when they are made available or only send data points when they change as compared to last published value, i.e., on exception. Where applicable by data point value primitive type, i.e., numeric types, the exception can be restricted to a deviation of last published value. Exceptions with specified deviations for numeric types would be calculated as the absolute value of the last published data point value minus the current data point value being greater than or equal to the specified deviation, e.g.: <code>canPublish = abs(lastValue – currentValue) &gt;= deviation</code>. The default deviation for any numeric primitive type will always be zero such that any change in value will trigger a publication. For any data points with values that are non-numeric primitive types, publisher will always send value when it changes, i.e., no deviation logic will be applied when sending by exception for non-numeric primitive data types.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/construction.png?v5" alt=":construction:" title=":construction:" class="emoji-img emoji"> Primitive data types need a clear classification of being "numeric" in order for exception characteristic to function properly.</p>
  <p><img src="https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/tomato.png?v5" alt=":tomato:" title=":tomato:" class="emoji-img emoji"> JO: Just for your consideration, in case you think this might be useful. SEL applies this "update by exception" rule by default for many tag types within the logic engine of our automation controller product and are referred to as "Deadbands". The behavior is the same as you've described in the paragraph above with one addition.  A second setting called "Zero Deadband" is presented which further defines the exception characteristic.  The exception condition would then be something like, e.g.: 'canPublish = (abs(lastValue - currentValue) &gt;= Deadband) AND currentValue &gt; ZeroDeadband'  This could be helpful in accounting for different modes of operation (testing/precommissioning/low level noise  vs nominal measurements).    </p>
  <p>Per data point deviation for numeric types will need to be accommodated in subscription request - this is too large to fit within single byte characteristic flags.</p>
  <p>As an optimization, deviation data should only be sent when exception characteristic is requested. Also, subscribers need to be able to group multiple delivery characteristic requests into a single message with an optimized payload size since request could be sizable for a very large number of data points.

<p>Per data point subscriber request would have publisher either always send data points at full resolution or with down-sampling. Down-sampling options include latest, closest, best-quality and filtered.</p>

<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Compression algorithms used with STTP can be either stateful, i.e., the compressor maintains its state through all compressed records, or stateless, i.e., the compressor compresses each data packet independently.</p>
<p>Stateful compression algorithms will provide the best possible compression for STTP data transmission but will require use of a reliable transport protocol, e.g., TCP. Stateless compression methods will be required when an unreliable transport protocol is being used for data transmission, e.g., UDP.</p>
<h3 id="compression-algorithms">Compression Algorithms</h3>
<p>STTP is designed so that new compression algorithms can be implemented and used without requiring revisions to the specification. To accommodate this, compression algorithms are negotiated, by text name and numeric version, after a connection is established along with other operational modes for the session. See <a href="Commands.md#negotiate-session-command">session negotiation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The negotiation process specifies both the stateful compression algorithm to use as well as the stateless compression algorithm, when applicable.  </p>
<p>The following compression algorithms are expected to always be available for STTP implementations such that a minimal set of compression algorithms will always be available for a publisher/subscription connection session negotiation.</p>

<p>Any compression algorithms used by STTP may not increase the content length by more than <code>1,024</code> bytes. If the decompression function is used with a compressed data packet that would decompress to a length greater than <code>16,384</code> bytes, it must report a decompression failure error.</p>

<h4 id="no-compression">No Compression</h4>
<p>It will always be possible for STTP to send data packets in their native binary format without any specified compression.</p>
<p>For the purposes of session negotiation the text name for selecting no compression algorithm is <code>NONE</code> and its version number will always be <code>0.0</code>.</p>
<h4 id="deflate-compression">Deflate Compression</h4>
<p>Deflate is an industry-standard algorithm that is used for lossless compression and decompression. The Deflate compression algorithm is defined in RFC 1951 <sup>[<a href="#ref19">19</a>]</sup>. This algorithm was chosen as a safe default option for an always available compression option in STTP since implementations of the protocol are widely available on various operating systems and programming languages.</p>
<p>The Deflate algorithm is technically a stateful algorithm, however, it is defined for use within STTP in either stateful or stateless modes. In a stateless mode, the Deflate algorithm will simply be applied to each data packet with its default initial state. The Deflate algorithm is the only default compression option that is specified for STTP stateless compression.</p>
<p>For the purposes of session negotiation the text name for the Deflate algorithm is <code>DEFLATE</code> and its version number is <code>1.0</code>.</p>
<h4 id="time-series-special-compression">Time-series Special Compression</h4>
<p>The Time-series Special Compression algorithm (TSSC) is an algorithm specifically designed for STTP that is used to quickly compress streaming time-series data with very good compression ratios. The TSSC algorithm is defined in <a href="#appendix-e---tssc-algorithm">Appendix E - TSSC Algorithm</a>.</p>
<p>TSSC is a stateful compression algorithm that is specifically designed to work with STTP streaming data packets. As such it is only designed for use in STTP when the data channel functions are established with a reliable transport protocol, e.g., TCP.</p>
<p>For the purposes of session negotiation the text name for the Time-series Special Compression algorithm is <code>TSSC</code> and its version number is <code>1.0</code>.</p>

<p><strong>E. Data Diode</strong></p>
<p>To facilitate moving data from a more secure environment to a less secure one (eg. Prod to Dev) a<br />
separate service will be created that can connect to (or accept connections from) a publisher. This<br />
communication can be a fully implemented sttp connection and thus can manage subscriptions that will be<br />
exported to lower level clients.</p>
<p>This data diode will then establish a connection with a lower security level and forward data to this<br />
client. The client will only be able to turn on/off the data stream, request metadata, and request a user<br />
configurable amount of historical data that may be missing during a communications outage. These requests<br />
must be handled by the data diode with no modifications made to the established connection to the publisher.<br />
Each connection must operate independently of each other.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The command channel will be used to reliably negotiate session-specific communication, state, and protocol parameters.  It will:</p>
<ul>
<li>exchange metadata information between gateways in a trusted union, with each publishing gateway only exchanging information that the subscribing gateway is allowed to view.</li>
<li>allow the connecting gateway to request points for a streaming data subscription from the publishing gateway. Requests for points that are not in the access control list for the subscribing gateway will be denied with a returned error.</li>
<li>minimize the bandwidth required for communicating measurement IDs and time-stamps.</li>
<li>allow the subscribing gateway to start and stop the data stream.</li>
<li>exchange and optionally synchronize measurement point metadata information received from external trusted gateway unions to the local configuration source so that users can examine points that are available for subscription.</li>
<li>enforce trusted gateway measurement point publication and subscription lists as defined in the configuration database. The system will drop data that it is not configured to receive.</li>
<li>provide the necessary mechanisms to negotiate QoS configuration with the receiving entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide the necessary communication to establish a trusted connection between a STTP publisher and subscriber by:</p>
<ul>
<li>establishment of a trusted STTP union will be handled through a manual configuration process out-of-band, that is, not over the gateway-to-gateway network over which the gateways communicate.</li>
<li>information being used to establish a trusted union between an STTP publisher and subscriber  will be protected on the local system and will be considered information known only to the two gateways participating in the union.</li>
<li>the gateways participating in the trusted union will exchange authentication information in an accepted and interoperable manner. For that reason, TLS and identity certificates should be used if possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>(2) streaming data - <strong>The Data Channel</strong></p>
<p>The data channel will be used to send compact packets of identifiable measured values along with a timestamp with high-fidelity accuracy and flags that can be used to indicate both time and data quality.</p>

<h4 id="subscription-delivery-options">Subscription Delivery Options</h4>
<p>Per subscription delivery window – this subscription level setting would constrain data delivery to a provided timespan (in terms of UTC based start and stop time). This could either be a maximum (future) time constraint for real-time data or, where supported by publisher, a historical data request.<br />
Publisher will likely want to validate size of historical requests, or least throttle responses, for very large historical requests.</p>
<h4 id="other-data-point-delivery-options">Other Data Point Delivery Options</h4>
<p>Send a sequence of values – with respect to specified per value delivery settings (think buffer blocks)</p>
<p>Send latest value – command allows for non-steaming request/reply, such as, translation to DNP3</p>
<p>Send historical values – subject to availability of local archive / buffer with start and stop time- it has been requested many times that single value data recovery option will be available to accommodate for simple UDP loss, however this should be carefully considered since this basically makes UDP and TCP style protocol – if implemented, restored point should likely flow over TCP channel to reduce repeat recovery requests. Also, this should include detail in response message that recovery either succeeded or failed, where failure mode could include “data not available”. To reduce noise, at connection time publisher should always let know subscriber its capabilities which might include “I Support Historical Data Buffer” and perhaps depth of available data. That said there is true value in recovery of data gaps that occur due to loss of connectivity.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Today most all synchrophasor deployments include IEEE C37.118 in various parts of the infrastructure, this section describes how STTP will be mapped to and from IEEE C37.118 streams so that interoperability can be established with the existing protocol implementations and STTP.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-d---other-protocol-evaluations">Appendix D - Other Protocol Evaluations</h2>
<p>Various other standard protocols were evaluated for suitability as a starting point for STTP, most were quickly eliminated for one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request / Reply (i.e., non-streaming) nature</li>
<li>Insufficient specified limits on data throughput</li>
<li>Restrictive payload formatting, e.g., inability to send binary data</li>
<li>Forced transport specifications, e.g., HTTP</li>
</ul>
<p>Other protocols that dealt with streaming data were found to not meet all the use case requirements that were desired for STTP. Suitability determinations for these protocols follows.</p>
<h3 id="rfc-3350---rtp-transport-protocol-for-real-time-applications">RFC 3350 - RTP: Transport Protocol for Real-Time Applications</h3>
<p>At first blush, there seems to be much overlap in the requirements defined for the STTP protocol and those defined for RTP. In particular, its ability to reliably deliver real-time streaming data with several channels (e.g., audio and video) to a participant.</p>
<p>At a high-level, here are some the features of RTP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio and video</li>
<li>Designed to be independent of the underlying transport</li>
<li>Services include payload type identification, sequence numbering, time-stamping and delivery monitoring</li>
<li>Primarily designed to satisfy the needs of multi-participant multimedia conferences</li>
</ul>
<p>RTP defines how to send, at a wire level, several related streams of data (i.e., content) for delivery to multiple participants simultaneously, i.e., all consumers receive the same data. However, since the desired use case for the STTP protocol can describe a different stream per consumer, i.e., where each consumer decides specifically what data they want, this multicast ability of RTP is not a feature that would be particularly useful. RTP also defines a fixed frame header timestamp that is used to synchronize several streams back together at the consumer level - such as lining up audio and video together for playback. The STTP use case, however, has a requirement to deliver a varying number of points each with its own timestamp, so the single header timestamp would not be useful – existing synchrophasor protocols also operate this way, i.e., with a single timestamp followed by payload measured at that time.</p>
<p>The RTP protocol also has stated caveats against multiplexing too many points:</p>
<pre><code>5.2 Multiplexing RTP Sessions

   For efficient protocol processing, the number of multiplexing points
   should be minimized, as described in the integrated layer processing
   design principle [10].  In RTP, multiplexing is provided by the
   destination transport address (network address and port number) which
   is different for each RTP session.  For example, in a teleconference
   composed of audio and video media encoded separately, each medium
   SHOULD be carried in a separate RTP session with its own destination
   transport address.

   Separate audio and video streams SHOULD NOT be carried in a single
   RTP session and demultiplexed based on the payload type or SSRC
   fields.</code></pre>
<p>This indicates that the most appropriate use of this protocol would be to define each data point stream onto its own network address/port number - this would not be ideal as the total number of port numbers on a system is a fixed resource and the number of data points two STTP connections will want to exchange could range in the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>Perhaps the largest technical issue with RTP for the STTP use case is the fixed number of possible multiplexed points. The RTP protocol defines a SSRC per packet header field as well as multiple CCRC per packet header fields that allow you to identify up to 16 points (SSRC + 15 CCRC) in the same packet for a given timestamp. If you ignored the header timestamp and other stated issues, it might be possible to make RTP work for the streaming data portion of the STTP use case requirements if you took the 16 packet points, each with a fairly large header, and applied per-point identification in the data payload for each packet – in this case the represented data could change packet-to-packet. However, doing this attempts to twist an existing protocol beyond its original design intentions to simply meet one portion of the needs of the current STTP use case simply for the sake of using an existing standard. This also does not solve the other STTP use case requirements, e.g., providing meta-data for the points being subscribed.</p>
<p>Regardless of the appropriateness of this standard to the desired use case, there is much that can be gleaned from this real-world production use protocol. In particular the dynamic ability to change encoding and frame-rates in response to changing network conditions should be noted as possible desired features of the STTP protocol.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-e---tssc-algorithm">Appendix E - TSSC Algorithm</h2>
<p>The Time-series Special Compression algorithm (TSSC) was specifically designed for STTP and is used to quickly compress streaming time-series data packets with very good compression ratios.</p>
<p>TSSC is a stateful compression algorithm is intended to be used when the STTP data channel functions are established with a reliable transport protocol, e.g., TCP.</p>
<p>Fundamentally TSSC works by applying simple XOR based compression techniques and only sending bits of data that have changed since the last saved state. Although many compression algorithms use this technique for compression, TSSC achieves high compression ratios with the same techniques by taking advantage of the data point structure in use by STTP, i.e., that data points are based on a fixed set of elements, specifically an identifier, a timestamp, a set of quality flags and a value block. From a stateful compression perspective, each of these structural elements can be treated as four separate compression streams and handled differently based on their homogeneous nature and repeating patterns in the continuous data.</p>
<p>Contributing to the compression algorithm's success is that streaming data has a tendency to have some level of sequencing. For example one measured value will often follow another where a new measured value will have a timestamp that will have only slightly changed since the last measurement. Also, if the measurements are taken very rapidly, the difference in the actual measured value may also be small. By taking advantage of these non-entropic states for individual structure elements, compression is improved.</p>

FYI, the following snippets were copied from GEP's TSSC implementation and will need to change based on architectural changes in STTP, e.g., multiple data types. Final code references should be in C language for a more universal example.</p>
